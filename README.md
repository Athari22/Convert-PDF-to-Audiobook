# ðŸ“˜ Convert PDF to Audiobook with Azure Speech

This Python project extracts text from a PDF file and converts it into an audiobook (MP3) using the [Azure Text-to-Speech API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/text-to-speech). It's a simple tool that can help you listen to documents instead of reading them.
